/*
 Software serial test

 Receives from serial RX, and then sends to serial TX
 data bits: 7, parity: even, 1 stop bit, with RTS/CTS

 The circuit: (BOARD RTL8195A)
 * RX is digital pin 0 (connect to TX of other device)
 * TX is digital pin 1 (connect to RX of other device)
 * RTS is digital pin 6 (connect to CTS of other device)
 * CTS is digital pin 3 (connect to RTS of other device)

 The circuit: (BOARD RTL8195A)
 * RX is digital pin 17 (connect to TX of other device)
 * TX is digital pin 5 (connect to RX of other device)
 * RTS is digital pin 7 (connect to CTS of other device)
 * CTS is digital pin 16 (connect to RTS of other device)
